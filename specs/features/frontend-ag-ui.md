## 🚨 Critical Technical Notes (Developer Lead Review)

### Backend Integration Requirements
1. **API Endpoint:** The backend has a **single stateless endpoint** `POST /api/v1/analyze` - NOT separate CV/job/analysis endpoints
2. **No Backend Storage:** All analysis history must be managed in **frontend localStorage** (per ADR-004)
3. **Recommendations are Strings:** Phase 1 backend returns `recommendations: string[]` - NOT structured objects. Frontend must handle gracefully.
4. **Response Schema:** Use `backend/app/models/responses.py` as source of truth for TypeScript type generation

### AG-UI Framework Validation Required
⚠️ **CRITICAL:** AG-UI framework availability and documentation must be verified before Phase 2 kickoff.
- **If AG-UI not available:** Fall back to **Fluent UI 2** (Microsoft design system) or **React + Radix UI**
- **Action Item:** Product/Engineering to confirm AG-UI readiness by Week 6

### Security Priorities
1. **File Upload Validation:** Client-side checks for file type, size, content (prevent XSS)
2. **Input Sanitization:** Strip control characters, normalize whitespace, no HTML rendering
3. **CSP Headers:** Configure Content Security Policy in Azure Static Web Apps
4. **Dependency Security:** `npm audit` in CI/CD, fail on critical vulnerabilities

### Performance Requirements
- **Page Load:** First Contentful Paint <1.5s, Time to Interactive <3s
- **API Timeout:** 60s for analysis (backend can take 20-30s), 10s for other endpoints
- **Lighthouse CI:** Enforce scores >90 (Performance), >95 (Accessibility) in CI/CD

### Testing Coverage
- **Unit Tests:** >80% coverage for utilities, state management, API client
- **Integration Tests:** Full workflows (upload → analyze → results)
- **E2E Tests:** Playwright/Cypress against staging environment
- **Accessibility Tests:** axe-core in CI/CD, manual NVDA/VoiceOver testing

#### FR-FE4.4: Recommendations List
**Description:** Display comprehensive, prioritized, actionable recommendations.

**Requirements:**
- **Categorization:** Group by type
  - ➕ Add (missing skills, keywords, experiences)
  - ✏️ Modify (rephrase, expand, restructure)
  - ⭐ Emphasize (make more prominent)
  - ➖ Remove (de-emphasize, condense)
- **Priority Indicators:** High, Medium, Low (visual badges)
- **Sortable/Filterable:** By priority, by category
- **Expandable Cards:** Click to expand for full details
- **Each Recommendation Includes:**
  - Title (concise action)
  - Category icon and priority badge
  - Short description (1-2 sentences)
  - Rationale (why it matters) - *Note: Phase 2 may return simple recommendations as strings*
  - Example (how to implement) - *Note: May not be available in initial backend version*
  - Expected impact (e.g., "+5 points to score") - *Note: Future enhancement*
- **Minimum Display:** 5 recommendations
- **Action Tracking (Future):** Checkbox to mark as "implemented"

**⚠️ Backend Alignment Note:** 
Current backend (Phase 1) returns recommendations as a simple `string[]` array. The frontend should:
1. Display recommendations as a list initially
2. Design UI to accommodate future structured recommendation objects when backend is enhanced
3. Use placeholder data for rationale/examples in mockups
4. Plan for backend API evolution in Phase 3

**Fallback Display Strategy (Phase 2):**
If backend returns simple strings:
- Display each recommendation in a card
- Auto-infer priority based on position (first 3 = High, next 3 = Medium, rest = Low)
- Omit rationale and examples (or use generic placeholders)
- Focus on clear, scannable list presentation

**UI Elements:**
```

| History List | DataTable or CardList, Pagination |
| Notifications | Toast, Alert |
| Modals | Dialog, Modal |

*(Note: Exact component names depend on AG-UI library documentation)*

---

### C. API Endpoints Used

From backend Phase 1 implementation (see [backend/README.md](../../backend/README.md)):

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Frontend Usage | Request Body | Response |
|----------|--------|---------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| `/api/v1/analyze` | POST | Analyze CV vs job | Analyze button action | `{cv_markdown: string, job_description: string}` | `AnalyzeResponse` (see below) |
| `/api/v1/health` | GET | Health check | App initialization, monitoring | None | `{status, version, service, azure_openai}` |
| `/api/v1/openapi.json` | GET | OpenAPI specification | Client generation | None | OpenAPI 3.0 JSON spec |

**⚠️ Important Backend Alignment Notes:**

1. **No separate CV/Job endpoints:** Unlike the table below suggests, the backend Phase 1 does NOT have separate `/api/v1/cvs` or `/api/v1/jobs` endpoints. Analysis is done in a single stateless call.

2. **No history endpoint yet:** `/api/v1/cvs/{cv_id}/analyses` does not exist in Phase 1. Frontend must manage history locally via localStorage.

3. **Stateless design:** Each analysis is independent. The backend doesn't store CVs, jobs, or analysis results (per ADR-004).

4. **Analysis Response Structure:**
```typescript
interface AnalyzeResponse {
  analysis_id: string;           // UUID for tracking
  overall_score: number;          // 0-100
  skill_matches: SkillMatch[];    // Detailed skill matching
  experience_match: object;       // Experience analysis (structure may vary)
  education_match: object;        // Education analysis (structure may vary)
  strengths: string[];            // Top strengths (plain strings)
  gaps: string[];                 // Identified gaps (plain strings)
  recommendations: string[];      // Action items (plain strings - no structure in Phase 1)
}

interface SkillMatch {
  skill_name: string;

5. **Frontend Responsibilities:**
- **History Management:** Store analysis results in localStorage (last 10)
- **Session Persistence:** Store current CV and job in localStorage
- **Client-Side Validation:** Enforce same rules as backend before API call
- **Graceful Degradation:** Handle missing fields in response (experience_match, education_match are objects with flexible schema)

**Future API Enhancements (Phase 3):**
- User authentication endpoints
- Persistent storage endpoints (save/retrieve CVs, jobs, analyses)
- Batch analysis endpoint
- Analysis comparison endpoint

### D. Localization Considerations (Future)

While Phase 2 is English-only, design with future localization in mind:

- Externalize all user-facing strings (i18n library)
- Avoid hardcoded text in components
- Use relative date/time formatting
- Design UI to accommodate text expansion (RTL languages can be 30% longer)
- Avoid text in images (use SVG icons)

---

### E. Browser Support

**Supported Browsers:**
- Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Edge (latest 2 versions)

**Mobile Browsers:**
- Safari on iOS (latest 2 major versions)
- Chrome on Android (latest 2 versions)

**Not Supported:**
- Internet Explorer (any version)
- Browsers >2 years old

### F. Design Tokens (AG-UI Theme)

Key design tokens to configure:

```javascript
{
  colors: {
    primary: "#0078D4",      // Microsoft blue
    success: "#107C10",      // Green (75-100 score)
    warning: "#F7B500",      // Yellow (50-74 score)
    error: "#D13438",        // Red (0-49 score)
    neutral: "#323130",      // Text
    background: "#FFFFFF",   // Page background
  },
  typography: {
    fontFamily: "Segoe UI, sans-serif",
    fontSize: {
      small: "12px",
      medium: "14px",
      large: "16px",
      xlarge: "20px",
      xxlarge: "28px",
    },
  },
  spacing: {
    xs: "4px",
    sm: "8px",
    md: "16px",
    lg: "24px",
    xl: "32px",
  },
  borderRadius: "4px",
  shadows: {
    card: "0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)",
    modal: "0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)",
  }
}
```
